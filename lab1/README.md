# Lab1: Task synchronization and parallelization

## Variant 10:

use Java, processes, java.nio.channels.AsyncronousSocketChannel and Future<T>.
  
Function operation: Disjunction. Manager operation: XOR.
  
## Implemented types of cancellation:
- Special key cancellation
- Periodic prompt cancellation

! NOTE: to measure computation time, special messages are printed to console, which can appear while user is entering their choice in prompt.
  These messages are only benchmarks, thus they do not contradict with statement that no computational messages can be printed while prompt is active.
